This code has two input: training set(train.csv) and test set(test.csv) that could be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 
Please make sure to put the two input data sets in correct folder to run the code.

The code was written in python and required numpy, pandas, matplot.lib, seaborn, and skylearn packages.

In lib folder there is one version TitanicAnalysisZonghaoLi-ZL2613.py for running in python and Titanic Analysis by Zonghao Li.ipynb for running in Ipython.

There is one output called output.csv which is the prediction of the test set.


The main steps in the analysis:


	1. Load the data and required packages
	

2. Delete, combine, and convert variables for further analysis
   
	
3. Deal with missing values


	4. Apply different machine learning algorithms and compare


	5. Get output and make conclusion.
